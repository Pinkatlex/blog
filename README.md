First of all you need to create a database in MySQL named 'blog', for that purposer you can run in your MySQLTerminal:

- CREATE DATABASE blog CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_general_ci;

After you create the db, just run the mnigrations and seeders. Open a Terminal in the folder project and run:
